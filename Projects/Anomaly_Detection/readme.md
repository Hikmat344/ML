# Anomaly Detection Project

## Overview
This repository contains code for an anomaly detection project. The project aims to detect anomalies or outliers in a given dataset using machine learning techniques. Anomalies are data points that deviate significantly from the norm or expected behavior, and detecting them is crucial for various applications such as fraud detection, network security, and industrial monitoring.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- `data/`: Directory containing sample datasets for demonstration purposes.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Source code directory containing Python scripts for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `results/`: Directory to store results, such as trained models, evaluation metrics, and visualization outputs.
- `README.md`: Markdown file providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/anomaly-detection-project.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Explore the `notebooks/` directory to understand the data and experiment with different anomaly detection algorithms.
4. Run the Python scripts in `src/` for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation on your dataset.
5. Experiment with different preprocessing techniques, algorithms, and hyperparameters to improve anomaly detection performance.

## Usage
- Use the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for interactive exploration and experimentation.
- Modify the Python scripts in the `src/` directory to suit your specific dataset and requirements.
- Refer to the documentation within the code and comments for detailed explanations of each function and module.

## Contributing
Contributions to the project are welcome! If you encounter any bugs, have feature requests, or want to contribute improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
