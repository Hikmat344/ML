# Machine Learning Projects
## Glad to see you here 
Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository! This collection includes some of the advanced ML projects I've worked on as part of my learning journey. Each project is designed to showcase various aspects of machine learning, from anomaly detection to recommendation systems.

## Project List
### 1. Anomaly Detection

- **Description:** Anomaly detection project that leverages machine learning techniques to identify outliers or anomalies in a given dataset.
- **Link:** [Anomaly Detection Project](/Anomaly_Detection)

### 2. Breast Cancer Detection

- **Description:** ML project focused on breast cancer detection, using a dataset to classify tumors as malignant or benign.
- **Link:** [Breast Cancer Detection Project](/Breast_Cancer)

### 3. Data Preprocessing

- **Description:** Exploratory project highlighting the importance of data preprocessing in the machine learning pipeline.
- **Link:** [Data Preprocessing Project](/Data_Preprocessing)

### 4. Heart Disease Detection

- **Description:** ML project for predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on various health-related features.
- **Link:** [Heart Disease Detection Project](/Heart_Disease_Detection)

### 5. Movies Recommendation (CBR)

- **Description:** Collaborative-based recommendation system for suggesting movies based on user preferences.
- **Link:** [Movies Recommendation (CBR) Project](/Movies_Recommendation)

### 6. Bank customer churn prediction ( kaggle competition )

- **Description:** Ml project for predicting whether a customer will churn/leave a bank or not using the bank dataset.
- **Link:** [Bank customer churn prediction ( kaggle competition )](/Bank customer churn prediction ( kaggle competition )
