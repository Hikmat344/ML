# Binary Classification with a Bank Churn Dataset
### Introduction
This GitHub project focuses on binary classification using a Bank Churn Dataset. The goal is to predict whether a bank customer will churn or not based on various features provided in the dataset. The project includes data preprocessing steps and the implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about bank customers, including features such as age, gender, account balance, credit score, etc. The target variable is whether the customer churned or not (1 for churned, 0 for not churned).

### Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps involve:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

### Model Implementation
Initially, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model was implemented for binary classification. However, the initial model suffered from overfitting issues, resulting in poor generalization to unseen data.

### Model Optimization
To address the overfitting problem, hyperparameters of the ANN model were adjusted. This involved tuning parameters such as the number of hidden layers, number of neurons per layer, activation functions, learning rate, and regularization techniques.

### Results
After optimizing the model hyperparameters, the ANN model achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test dataset. This indicates that the model is performing well in predicting whether bank customers will churn or not.
