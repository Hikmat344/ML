# Heart Disease Detection using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Introduction
This project aims to detect heart disease using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning algorithm. Heart disease is a significant health concern worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in preventing severe complications. By leveraging the power of machine learning, this project aims to provide a reliable tool for identifying individuals at risk of heart disease based on their health data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [kaggle]. It contains various attributes related to the health status of individuals, including age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant factors. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and ensure data quality before applying the KNN algorithm.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, feature normalization, and encoding categorical variables to prepare it for the KNN algorithm.
2. **Model Training**: The preprocessed dataset is split into training and testing sets. The KNN algorithm is trained on the training data to learn the patterns and relationships between the input features and the presence of heart disease.
3. **Model Evaluation**: The trained KNN model is evaluated using the testing data to assess its performance in detecting heart disease. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to measure the model's effectiveness.
4. **Deployment**: Once the model is trained and evaluated satisfactorily, it can be deployed as a standalone application or integrated into a larger healthcare system for real-world use.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- NumPy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `heart_disease_detection.py` script to train the KNN model and evaluate its performance.
4. Adjust hyperparameters and experiment with different configurations to optimize the model further.

## Results
The results of the heart disease detection model are presented in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into the model's performance and its ability to correctly classify individuals with and without heart disease.

## Future Improvements
- Explore other machine learning algorithms and compare their performance with KNN.
- Enhance the preprocessing steps to handle outliers and feature selection more effectively.
- Incorporate additional features or datasets to improve the model's predictive capabilities.
- Develop a user-friendly interface for the heart disease detection tool to facilitate its usage by healthcare professionals.
